# Global-Cancer-Patient-Dashboard

**Project Overview**

The Global Cancer Patient Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze cancer patient data across multiple countries and time periods. The dashboard provides critical insights into patient demographics, survival rates, cancer types, and geographic trends, supporting healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers in their efforts to improve cancer treatment and prevention strategies.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**

Monitor global cancer cases and mortality rates.

Analyze patient demographics such as age, gender, and country.

Track survival years and outcomes based on diagnosis type.

Visualize cancer types and their distribution by region.

Provide data-driven insights to support healthcare decisions and research initiatives.

**ðŸ“Œ Features**

**KPI Cards**: Total Patients, Survivors, Mortality Rate, Average Survival Years.

**Demographic Analysis**: Patient breakdown by age group, gender, and region.

**Cancer Type Distribution**: Identify the most and least common cancer types.

**Geographical Mapping**: Visual representation of cases by country/region.

**Trend Charts**: Analyze diagnosis trends over years (2015â€“2024).

**Interactive Filters**: Explore data by cancer type, age range, gender, and year.

**Tools & Technologies**

**Power BI**: Data modeling, report building, and interactive visualization.

**Kaggle**:Source of global cancer patient data

**Excel / CSV Dataset**: Used for data cleaning.

**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating custom measures like survival rates and mortality ratios.

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights**

Breast and lung cancers were the most prevalent across all regions.

Patients diagonised at age group (41-60) and (61-80) has higher survival years shockingly compared to age group (21-40).

**Survival rates** have shown improvement year-over-year due to better access to screening and treatment.

Developing regions recorded higher mortality rates, highlighting disparities in healthcare access.
